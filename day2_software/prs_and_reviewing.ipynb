    "Authors: Tom Robitaille, Erik Tollerud, Brigitta Sipocz\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful skill in both astronomy and the wider software world to be able to make contributions to software repositories using *pull requests*. (This is what they are called on GitHub - they go by other similar names in other places - e.g. *merge requests* on GitLab).  This is useful whether you are working as part of a collaboration that is using git repositories for common code, or if you want to contribute to an open code base that is being developed in a git repository, \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main benefits to making contributions via pull requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It allows other people to review the changes you are requesting and make their own suggestions on your code before they are merged (i.e. before they are incorporated into the main repository)\n",
    "* It allows anyone to contribute by proposing changes to any repository without taking on the risk of many people having write-access to the main repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through the process of opening a pull request, and we will also take some time to review other participant's pull requests. We will take the example of a repository on GitHub, but note that the workflow will be similar for other platforms such as GitLab and BitBucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you are using Windows, you might find it helpful to use [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: Making some changes and opening a pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a: Fork the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository we will be opening pull requests to is at https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/pr_review_tutorial. Since you don't have write access to this repository, the first step will be to make a \"fork\" of the repository. This is basically a copy of the main repository, but one that you have complete control to modify as you see fit (and that is visible to everyone else on GitHub).  Make sure you are logged in to GitHub, then go to the repository and click the 'Fork' button:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src=\"images/fork.png\" alt=\"The button to fork a repository\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a copy of the repository at ``https://github.com/<username>/pr_review_tutorial`` where ``<username>`` is your GitHub username.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b: Clone your fork\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have forked your repository, you can clone it to your computer using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/<username>/pr_review_tutorial\n",
    "    \n",
    "Be sure to replace ``<username>`` with your GitHub username!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c: Familiarize yourself with the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the repository has been cloned, ``cd`` into it and check what files are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd pr_review_tutorial\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a set of directories, with one directory per participant (ordered by last name). Go into the directory with your last name, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd tollerud\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should now see the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``README.md``: basic documentation for some of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``simple_functions.py``: a set of simple functions that should work properly\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``buggy_function.py``: a function that contains one or more bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at these files, and familiarize yourself with the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1d: Make a new branch\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, you will be looking at the ``master`` (or main) \"branch\" of the repository. You're going to make some changes to the code, but who knows... maybe the reviewers will spend so long reviewing your changes that you want to do another set of unrelated changes in the mean time. Thus it's always best to make changes in a dedicated branch. So before you make any changes, make a new branch with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git branch <name-of-branch>\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can then switch to this branch with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git checkout <name-of-branch>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that you can also write ``git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`` as a short-hand for the above two commands. Branch names should be kept simple and reasonably short, and can't include e.g. spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1e: Make some changes\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can pick what kind of changes you would like to make - and we've provided three different types of changes depending on what you are mos. You can choose to tackle more than one of these if you like, but since we are limited in time, the aim is to just do one of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As you've probably noticed, the documentation in ``README.md`` is... not great. Try and edit it to make it more readable! You can edit the text, and choose to add more examples if you like (and potentially fix the existing ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a new function in ``simple_functions.py`` called ``is_prime`` that takes an integer number and returns ``True`` if the number is prime, and ``False`` if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try and find the bug(s) in the ``buggy_function.py`` file and fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done at least one of these, you can move to the next step!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1f: Commit the changes and push it to your fork\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've made changes, the next step is to commit these changes to the repository. You can see what files have changed since the last commit with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git status\n",
    "    \n",
    "We now need to 'stage' files before committing them - the difference between staging and committing files is that staging consists of selecting which files you will want to commit changes for (you may want to separate the commits for changes to different files for some reason). To stage files, use the ``git add`` command as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git add file-to-stage\n",
    "    \n",
    "and repeat this for each file you want to include in the next commit. You can use ``git status`` to check which files have been staged for committing. Once you are happy with the files that have been staged, you can create a commit in the repository using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Message describing the changes here\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Be sure to edit the commit message to be descriptive, so that anyone looking at the git history has an idea of roughly what each commit does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good commit message:** ``Fixed bug in this_function which was due to an off-by-one error``\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad commit message:** ``Fixed stuff. It's Friday evening and I want to go home now``\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now check that your commit is in the history using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git log\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the commit is there, you are now ready to push your changes to GitHub! You can do this using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git push origin <name-of-branch>\n",
    "    \n",
    "If this succeeds, you are ready for the next step. If you get an error about the changes being rejected, ask your friendly instructors!\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 1g: Open a pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, go to your fork on GitHub at ``https://github.com/<username>/pr_review_tutorial``, and you should see a yellow-ish banner that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pushed.png\" width=\"700\" alt=\"The yellow-ish banner on GitHub showing a branch has been pushed\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on **Compare & pull request**. You will then see a screen like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/compare.png\" width=\"700\" alt=\"A preview of the changes for the pull request\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, give your pull request a sensible title, and use the description box to describe what changes you've made, why you made them, and you can also mention if there are any unresolved issues for example. You can also preview the changes by scrolling down on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you don't see the yellow banner (for example, if you went and did something else after pushing so that it timed out), you can also make a pull request by choosing your branch from the drop-down menu and then choosing 'New pull request'\n",
    "\n",
    "Once ready, hit **Create pull request**, and you're done!"

    "## Problem 2: Reviewing someone else's pull request\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've opened a pull request, take a look at what other pull requests have been opened and find one other than yours, and leave a comment to indicate that you would like to review it (a short message like 'I am going to review this' is fine). If possible try and pick one that no one else has offered to review yet, but if needed you can review one that is already being reviewed by someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "To review a pull request, first take a look at the description for the pull request, then go to the **Files changed** tab. Here you will see the line by line changes from the pull request If you like, you can leave in-line comments by hovering over the left of the lines by clicking on the blue **+**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/plus.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Click plus for adding comment\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can make a comment then click **Start a review**. If you add more comments, you will need to click on **Add to review**. Once you've finished adding comments, you can click on **Finish your review** in the top right above the detailed changes, and leave a general message and your recommendation (approve or request changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what should you comment on? Anything you think can be improved or that you don't understand! For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can ask for comments to be added to code that's not intuitive\n",
    "* You can comment on the coding style\n",
    "* You can point out mistakes/bugs\n",
    "* You can suggest additions to the code using the 'Insert a suggestion' option in the GitHub interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In general make sure you comment constructively (and maybe even friendly)! You can also choose to leave comments that don't require changes, e.g. 'Nice approach!'. If a pull request is perfect, you can just skip adding in-line comments and just leave a general comment and approve the pull request. In general you have the choice to approve or ask for revision - while in a repo like this where you don't have write access, these are not binding, but they are critical signals to the actual maintainers whether you feel the code is ready to be accepted or not.  If you don't feel ready to say something firm either way you can always just leave your review as a comment, which serves to neither ask for changes nor accept the pull request."

    "## Problem 3: Making additional changes\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone comments on your pull request and you decide to follow their recommendations, you can add new changes to the pull request without having to open a new one. To do this, just make any changes you need, then stage the files to change with ``git add`` as described above, then commit the changes with ``git commit`` and use ``git push`` to push the changes to your branch. The commit will then appear in the pull request. Once you think it's all ready, you might want to ask one of the instructors if they are willing to merge your PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 4: Documentation or Tests - Choose your own adventure!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, there are three things you can learn more about, building on the three examples of improvable code that have been outlined above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* While a README file is fine for very simple code, in general we recommend that you write more fully-fledged documentation using a framework such as [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). If you want to learn about how to do this, you can follow the notebook in this folder on **[Code Documentation](documentation.ipynb)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you fix bugs or add new functions in code, you really should be adding tests to make sure that the code works and that bugs that have been fixed are not re-introduced. If you want to learn about this, take a look at the **Code [Testing and CI](testing_and_CI.ipynb)** notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to know how to set a Python package up from scratch and publish it so that it can be installed from `pip` and/or used by you in *other* places other than where the package itself is located, take a look at the **[Packaging](packaging.ipynb)** notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have gone through one of these, you can always try and add more commits to your pull request to add tests or some documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced - dealing with changes in the primary repository\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are opening a pull request on a busy repository such as the core astropy repository, someone may make improvements to the code after you have opened it, and you may need to rely on their changes. If this happens, you can use ``git remote`` to add the main repository as a source you can get changes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git remote add upstream https://github.com/AstroHackWeek/pr_review_tutorial\n",
    "    \n",
    "You only need to do this once for a given local repository. Once this is done, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git fetch upstream\n",
    "    \n",
    "to fetch the latest changes from the main repository. Note that this won't update your code - to do this, make sure all your changes are committed, and then use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git rebase upstream/master\n",
    "    \n",
    "Provided that there are no changes in the main repository that conflict, you should then be good to go and your local branch will contain both the latest changes from the main repository, and your local changes. If you previously pushed your branch to GitHub, you will then need to make sure you push using the ``--force`` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git push --force origin <name-of-branch>\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are conflicts, you can take a look at [this GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) on how to resolve them."
